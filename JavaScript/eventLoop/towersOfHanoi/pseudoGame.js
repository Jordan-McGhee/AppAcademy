// Before you start, write out Game.prototype.run in pseudocode (using comments). For example, if I were to write the pseudocode for Chess.prototype.run, it would look something like:

// class Chess {
//     run() {
//       // until a player is in checkmate
//       // get move from current player
//       // make move on board
//       // switch current player
//     }
//   }

class Game {
    run () {
        // until a player has moved all rings from the left post to the right post
        // get move from player
        // check if the move is a valid move
        // a move is only valid if a small piece is played on top of a larger piece
    }
}
